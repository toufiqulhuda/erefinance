### Introduction:
Banks are allowed to provide loans without maintaining internal credit risk rating system (ICRRS) 
to the cottage, micro, small and medium enterprise (CMSME) sector under the Tk 200-billion stimulus package.
The government has recently announced the bailout package for the sector with an intent to help the stakeholders overcome the Covid-19 fallout.
The Bangladesh Bank (BB) has relaxed the guideline, allowing banks to disburse package loans on the basis of bank-customer relationship, according to a notification issued.
All the scheduled banks are eligible to provide loans without following ICRRS only for the stimulus package to help such businesses resume quickly.
The banks are now eligible to analyse credit risks applying their own responsibilities.
